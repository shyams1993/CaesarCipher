# CaesarCipher
Python library to encipher &amp; decipher a string using one of the simplest Substitution ciphers - "Caesar's Cipher"

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence

This library contains an Encipher method and a Decipher method to encipher & decipher a string, respectively, using a shiftkey.
